# My Fullstack Next.js App

This is a fullstack Next.js application that I built to practice MongoDB CRUD operations. It allows me to perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a MongoDB database.

## Features

- Create new records in the database
- Read existing records from the database
- Update existing records in the database
- Delete records from the database

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive designs
- JavaScript: A programming language that allows you to add interactivity to websites
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection in the application
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
5. Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `<your-mongodb-uri>` with your own MongoDB URI:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
   ```
6. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
